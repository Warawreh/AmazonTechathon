<h1>University Student Assistant Website</h1>

<h2> How to use the website as an Admin</h2>
For admins the most important thing we want is to upload courses and majors to the website, which can be done by creating an normal account from the sign-up page then changing the role of this account to an admin by adding it to the admin list then going to the adminpanal.php sub-domain which will check if the current user is an admin or not if he is an admin he can procced to the admin panel page which have two forms:

the first one for submitting courses that needs :
- id of the course
- name of the course
- the course University
- hours of the course

and after filling the data and submitting the data it will be saved in the database as a new course

the second form is for submitting majors which needs:
- name of the major
- the major University
- the major facility
- the major hours
- the major courses

and after filling the data and submitting the data it will be saved in the database as a new major
